My grandfather was Wiley Petit Bullard born in Texas in the 1850s. His father was James R.S. Bullard, who came to Texas with his uncle, 
James Alfred Head (a part of the long standing relationship with the Head and Bullard families). 
James was the son of John and Mary (Head) Bullard. John Bullard was the son of James Bullard (married to Sarah Pittman?) 
also fathered Jarmony (sometimes spelled Jermany, or even Germany or Germony) and Sion Record, among a bunch of other children. 
Seems like I've seen Jarmony's name over the last couple of days as well--so there's a connection.

Anyway, I have pretty much all the scoop on Wiley Petit, if anyone is interested
